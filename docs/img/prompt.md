logo for program for chatting with large language models, based on a friendly robot face
```

revised prompt:

```
Design a logo representing a program used for engaging in conversations with large language models. The logo should visually convey interaction and comprehension. Center the design around an amicable robot face, highlighting the traits of approachability and intelligence. The robot should have a friendly smile and its eyes should imply an understanding. Use a blend of modern and futuristic aesthetics, with simplicity and clean lines. Keep the color palette cool and understate, preferably with shades of blue and grey, to bring out the technology and digital theme.
