r0b0t is a GTK+ application for interacting with Large Language Models from OpenAI, and also with GitHub Copilot.

## Installation

- On Ubuntu requires `apt install appmenu-gtk3-module`
- create a `.env` file with variables `openai_key`, `github_key` and `anthropic_key`, in the same directory where the program runs; or make sure at least one of them is defined when doing so.
